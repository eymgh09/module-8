    <h2> WATERCOLORS TIPS</h2>
  <!--paragraphs -->
        <p> Natural brushes are better than synthetics, and if you can only afford one brush, choose a natural round brush. If you can afford two brushes, get a small round and a medium round (or a medium round and a large round, depending on whether you like to work big or small).

            This is all you need to get started - you can worry about the other sizes and shapes later!
            
            If you're on a budget, you'll be happy to know that you can create an entire watercolor painting using just one brush! I've done this quite a few times, using just a small round brush.</p>
     
            <p>1. Paper<br>Not all paper is created equally! If you're going to watercolor, it is essential that you use actual watercolor paper. Below is a comparison of a watercolor wash on regular copy paper, and another on watercolor paper with the same paint mix. The copy paper isn't made in the same way as watercolor paper and results in a buckled, wavy wash. The copy paper also pills, meaning the fibers start to tear and ball up on the sheet. The watercolor paper is heavier weight and is made with additives called "sizing" that allows it to absorb moisture in the proper way. It remains flat, has an even color tone, and doesn't pill or tear. </p>  
      <p>2. Brushes<br>You don't need to start with a huge assortment of brushes, but a few key types will help as you try to achieve different results. A small, medium and large round brush, a flat brush, and a mop brush is a great way to start. Each brush is created for an intended purpose. Check out Princeton Artist Brush's page to get a good idea of the types of brushes available and what each does. </h4>
      <p>3. Work from light to dark<br>With watercolor it's important to lay down your light colors first and work towards the darker colors. Have patience - there's no rush. We start with the light colors first because once you lay down the dark colors, it's hard to undo. Due to the transparency of watercolor, your light colors won't show if they're covered up by dark colors. Also, the white and light areas of your painting are coming from the paper, so plan ahead and keep in mind which areas you want to keep white. Masking fluid is a great way to reserve areas of white on your painting. </p>     
      <p>4. Watercolor Pads<br>Aside from the thickness, you will also want to pay attention to the texture of the paper. Hot-press paper has a smooth, hard surface that makes it ideal for fine detail work, but it's often criticized as being slippery and challenging to control. Cold-press has a semi-rough surface that’s suitable for detail work and washes, but you can see some of the texture peeking through. Rough paper is exactly that—it has a rigid texture. Because of this, it’s great if you enjoy creating washes of color. The texture allows the pigment extra drying time. <p>
      <p>5. Plant you white sections<br>Because watercolor is so fluid, it's important to plan your white sections in advance. For instance, if you want a nice, clean white border around your painting, consider placing masking tape around the edges of the paper before you get started.</h4>
      <p>6. Go with the flow<br>The last essential tip for watercolor painting is to remember to go with the flow. While there are techniques you can learn and master, it's also good to keep in mind that because watercolor paint is water-based, you can't control everything that will happen—and that's okay. Small mistakes are fairly easy to cover up with blending and mixing, and sometimes they can even add to the beauty of your art.</p>
