<p><br>VERY IMPORTANT</br>If you want to be able to paint with watercolor, decent paper is very important. Without good paper, your painting will never reach its full potential. Poor paper quality will affect even the best artist’s work. Another factor to take into account is that when we use this medium, we are using water. This means that our paper needs to be able to withstand the water and not warp. Using scotch or masking tape to hold your paper down will help keep everything in place and restrict your paper from shifting. For this “how to watercolor” tutorial, we have divided our paper into eight sections using a ruler and some masking tape. Resulting in eight equal spaces to practice each of the upcoming watercolor techniques. </p>


            <p><mark>Watercolor wash technique:</mark>  If you notice a mistake in a previous stroke, don’t try to fix it. Once the wash has started to dry, a new stroke will almost definitely be more noticeable than any small mistake. It’s best to leave these happy little accidents as they are<br>here are some techniques to get you started</br>Water color wash<br>There’s more than one way to approach laying a watercolor wash — you can either do it on a wet surface or a dry one</p>

                <p><mark>Dry wash technique:</mark> Use a large flat or round brush and an angled surface like a drafting table or easel (this way gravity does some work for you.) On your palette, mix a generous amount of water with your chosen pigment. Remember that watercolors dry lighter than they look when they’re wet. You might want to practice on a scrap of watercolor paper first.

                    Load your brush with as much paint as it’ll hold. Then, working quickly, make a steady, controlled horizontal stroke along the top of the paper. You’ll notice the water in the first stroke starts to pool along the bottom edge — don’t let this dry! Reload your brush with pigment and paint another stroke just below the first one, overlapping with the bottom edge.</p>
                    
          

      <p><mark>Masking tape ruber cement</mark>  Rubber cement (like masking tape) acts as a resist for watercolor. Apply this material in places where you don’t want the pigment to go. Once the watercolor is dry, peel the rubber cement or masking tape from the page. You’ll see the paper underneath. This is a great solution for preserving white paper among the rest of your painting. If rubber cement results in a piece that is too fluid or abstract for you, try this same technique with masking tape—you'll be able to get that perfect vertical line or crisp shape you're looking for.</p>
